# Chat

The `Chat` component is a flexible interface for displaying conversations. It supports different message types, reactions, and can be configured for various communication channels like standard chat, SMS, or team discussions.

## How to use

To use the `Chat` component, you need to import it and provide it with an array of messages.

```tsx
import { Chat } from "./Chat";
import { sampleMessages, reactions } from "./data";

<Chat
  chatInterface="CHAT"
  content={sampleMessages}
  reactions={reactions}
  enableTeamChat={true}
/>;
```

## Props

The `Chat` component accepts the following props:

<ArgTypes of={Chat} />

## Stories

### With Messages

This is the standard view of the chat, displaying a list of messages.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={ChatStories.WithMessages} />
</Canvas>

### Empty

This view shows the component when there are no messages to display.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={ChatStories.Empty} />
</Canvas>

### Team Chat Enabled

When `enableTeamChat` is true, the input area changes to provide team-chat-specific functionalities.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={ChatStories.TeamChatEnabled} />
</Canvas>
